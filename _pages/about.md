Since 2021, I have been studying Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. My academic journey has taken me through a deep exploration of Mathematical Engineering, 
with a specific focus on Statistical Learning, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing. This academic path has allowed me to combine my passion for mathematics with a drive 
to tackle real-world challenges and develop innovative solutions.  
As an enthusiast for applying mathematical concepts to practical problems, I find great satisfaction in leveraging my knowledge to work with machine learning algorithms and 
data analysis techniques. This hands-on experience has provided me with a solid foundation in turning data into actionable insights.  
My academic pursuits have naturally led me to the exciting intersection of statistics, mathematics, and computer science. I am particularly drawn to this convergence, 
where I have the opportunity to push the boundaries of knowledge and explore novel applications of these disciplines.  

My educational background includes a BSc in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.
