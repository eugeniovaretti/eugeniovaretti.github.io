Surface reconstruction from a point cloud consists of a collection of algorithms that allow obtaining a continuous surface from a discrete set of points. When the input point cloud is regular and smooth, most methods work well and produce an accurate mesh reconstruction. However, in practical applications, point clouds are often obtained from scanning, which can introduce imperfections, leading to complex geometries where existing algorithms may fail. The aim of this work is to develop a robust method for reconstructing meshes from point clouds, even in conditions characterized by complex geometries.
