## Introduction
SipLink presents a solution to a widespread issue: chronic dehydration. Addressing this issue demands a solution that is intuitive, effective, and seamlessly integrated into daily life.
The core product idea is the Sip-n-tap bracelet, a device potentially capable of monitoring hydration state in real-time by merging biological and environmental data with user inputs. Thanks to recent advances in learning systems and sensor technology, this goal is attainable.
The system is paired with an innovative one-button water intake tracking interface that allows the system as a whole to improve overall hydration habits. The bracelet, configurable by a companion app, could eventually be coupled with Sip-it and Sip-me bottles to maximize comfort and precision.
