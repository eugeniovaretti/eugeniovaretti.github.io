## Introduction
This collaborative project aims to create a mathematical model of an aneurysm within the venous system. The model will be based on a 2D image obtained from an MRI scan. 
The project incorporates techniques such as image segmentation, shape modelling, mesh reconstruction, and numerical computation on the obtained meshes.
Further information on the project's aims and methodology can be found in the [dedicated report](/files/posts_pdf/Piazza_Romano_Varetti_Report2.pdf).
