## Introduction

This collaborative project aims to create a mathematical model of an aneurysm within the venous system. The model will be based on a 2D image obtained from an MRI scan.  

The initial phase of the project involves implementing image segmentation and reconstruction through shape modelling.

The subsequent two stages consist of reconstructing the mesh and conducting a numerical simulation to determine the pressure and blood velocity within the aneurysm domain.

The project incorporates techniques such as image segmentation, shape modelling, mesh reconstruction, and numerical computation on the obtained meshes.
Further information on the project's aims and methodology can be found in the [dedicated report](/files/posts_pdf/Piazza_Romano_Varetti_Report2.pdf).
